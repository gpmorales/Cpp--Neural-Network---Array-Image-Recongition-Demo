## C Neural Network - Array Image Recognition Demo

### Project Overview
A neural network implementation in C that recognizes simple pixel arrays (low-resolution images). Currently configured to identify 'X's and 'O's patterns for potential application integration.

### Key Features
* Custom Matrix library for neural network computations
* Low-resolution image recognition capabilities
* Specialized for 'X' and 'O' pattern recognition
* Built entirely in C for optimal performance

### Technical Implementation
* **Matrix Operations**: 
  - Custom matrix library implementation
  - Handles all neural network computations
  - Optimized for training and inference

* **Neural Network Components**:
  - Feed-forward architecture
  - Training implementation
  - Pattern recognition algorithms

### Future Applications
This demo serves as a foundation for future applications, particularly in:
* Simple pattern recognition tasks
* Game development (Tic-tac-toe applications)
* Basic computer vision implementations
